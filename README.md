Hi there ğŸ‘‹, I am a senior in university who wants to be a <b>machine learning engineer</b>. ğŸ’»<br>
I'm also interested in <b>computer vision</b>, and I sometimes develop the <b>backend</b>. ğŸ”¥
</div><br>

<div>
My hobbies were soccer, traveling, and playing games, but now I have become a hobby of developing them while practicing at Institute. ğŸš€<br>
When my code is shown as a result, and when I learn new things along the way, it makes me feel really good and confident. ğŸ˜„
</div><br>

<div>I want to develop many cool things now and forever! ğŸ˜†</div><br>
